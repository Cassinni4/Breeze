# Welcome to Breeze!

This is a mod that attempts to restore unfinished and unused content for the game.

I most likely won't be checking in on the GitHub page very often, so if you want to report a bug, ask a question, or get the latest news, go to the Disney Infinity Discord, as I am very active there.
You could also PM me directly: Cassinni4
